            <p>🌙 Light from the Qur’an | A Blog Reflecting on the Words of Allah
📖 Post 1: Surah Al-Fatiha — The Opening of Mercy and Guidance
“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.”
(Surah Al-Fatiha, 1:1)

🌟 Reflection:
Surah Al-Fatiha is the heart of the Qur’an — recited in every prayer, it reminds us of Allah’s mercy and our constant need for His guidance.

"Ar-Rahman" (The Most Gracious) and "Ar-Raheem" (The Most Merciful) are two beautiful names of Allah that show His unmatched kindness and love.

Every action should begin with Bismillah, reminding us to seek blessings and sincerity.

🧠 Life Lessons:
Always start your tasks with Allah’s name.

Be kind and merciful toward others, as Allah is merciful to us.

🙏 Practical Tip:
Before eating, studying, or making decisions — say “Bismillah” with intention. It brings blessings and protects your heart.

🌿 Words of the Prophet ﷺ | A Hadith Reflection Blog
📜 Post 1: Intentions Matter Most
“Actions are judged by intentions, and every person will get what they intended.”
— Sahih al-Bukhari & Muslim

💡 Reflection:
This is one of the most powerful and foundational hadiths in Islam. It teaches us that Allah doesn’t just look at what we do — He looks at why we do it.

A good deed with the wrong intention may lose its reward. But a small act, done sincerely for Allah, can carry immense value in the Hereafter.

🧠 Life Lessons:
Before praying, giving charity, helping others, or even smiling — ask yourself: "Am I doing this for Allah?"

Sincerity (Ikhlas) makes even ordinary actions into acts of worship.

Don’t seek praise from people; seek acceptance from Allah.

✅ Try This Today:
Choose one action — like helping someone or making dua — and do it only for Allah, without telling anyone. Reflect on how that feels.

            <h1><u>Sunnah</u></h1>
            <p>🌟 Living the Sunnah | A Blog on the Way of the Prophet ﷺ
🕊️ Post 1: The Sunnah of Smiling 😊
The Prophet ﷺ said:
“Your smile for your brother is a charity.”
— [Jami’ at-Tirmidhi]

💡 Reflection:
A simple smile — sincere and kind — can be an act of worship in Islam. The Prophet ﷺ was known for his warm, approachable, and cheerful nature. He smiled often and taught his companions to spread joy.

Today, in a world full of stress and negativity, reviving this small Sunnah can make a big difference.

🧠 Life Lessons:
Sunnah is not just about prayer and fasting — it's also about how we treat others.

A smile can uplift someone’s mood and build bonds of love and brotherhood.

It's a form of sadaqah (charity) — no money, just sincerity.

✅ Try This Sunnah Today:
Make a conscious effort to smile at at least 3 people today — your family, a neighbor, or a stranger — with the intention of following the Sunnah.
